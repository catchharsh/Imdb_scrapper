> Web scrapper for IMDB  

I have used web scrapping to get the data of various top rated movies of different genre from Imdb.  

_**This program will receive a genre from user, then will tabularize top 50 movies as per US votes sorted in decreasing order of their Imdb ratings.**_      

I have implemented a **JSON file** to store the data from scraping and used **Pandas** to tabularize it.  

Use of the following genres are allowed (it makes up mostly all):  
  - Action
  - Adventure
  - Animation
  - Biography
  - Comedy
  - Crime
  - Documentary
  - Drama
  - Family
  - Fantasy
  - Film-Noir
  - History
  - Horror
  - Music

  - Mystery
  - Romance
  - Sci-Fi
  - Sport
  - Thriller
